# Crash Bandicoot 4 - Widescreen Fix
## Description
This is a small mod that allows _Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time_ to run at aspect ratios wider than 16:9. Unlike
previous hex-editor based fixes, this correctly scales the field of view at all times for a perfect Hor+ widescreen
scale. Note that currently FMV cutscenes will be stretched rather than displayed at their correct aspect ratio, I plan
to fix this sometime in the future.

## Instructions
1. Download the [.zip file containing the mod](https://github.com/RibShark/Crash4WidescreenFix/releases/latest).
2. Extract all files to `<game folder>\Lava\Binaries\Win64`, so that `dsound.dll` resides in the same folder as 
`CrashBandicoot4.exe` or `Lava-Win64-Shipping.exe`.
